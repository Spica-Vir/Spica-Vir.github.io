I am not saying that I ‘learned’ it since it is a lifelong learning process. VMware Player was the first virtual machine platform that I learned to use, thanks to the molecular dynamics lecture delivered by Prof. W. Qi (齐卫宏 教授) at NWPU - by the way he gave ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Revisiting SSH - Key Pair and Configuration file</title><link href="https://spica-vir.github.io/posts/SSH-revisit/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Revisiting SSH - Key Pair and Configuration file" /><published>2023-09-14T19:33:49+01:00</published> <updated>2023-09-15T12:10:10+01:00</updated> <id>https://spica-vir.github.io/posts/SSH-revisit/</id> <content src="https://spica-vir.github.io/posts/SSH-revisit/" /> <author> <name>Spica.Vir</name> </author> <category term="Technique" /> <category term="SSH" /> <summary> Recently I reset my WSL virtual machine, which forces me to regenerate ssh key pair for ARCHER2. Some useful commands and configurations are documented here for reference. Tested on 12th September, 2023. Generate and copy SSH key SSH key is a requirement for ARCHER2, but not for other clusters. It is not until recently that I found that can save a lot of time.

Even though some questions remains to be answered, it currently seems to be the optimal procedure. Tested on NHPC101 (OpenSUSE Leap 15.3), Dec. 29, 2022. FFTW is a portable package for fast Fourier transformation (FFT), which is useful in multiple applications. One of its important applications in DFT is that it tran... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>LAMMPS compilation and integration with Python</title><link href="https://spica-vir.github.io/posts/LAMMPS-compilation-and-integration-with-Python/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="LAMMPS compilation and integration with Python" /><published>2022-12-30T15:32:20+00:00</published> <updated>2023-02-12T21:46:08+00:00</updated> <id>https://spica-vir.github.io/posts/LAMMPS-compilation-and-integration-with-Python/</id> <content src="https://spica-vir.github.io/posts/LAMMPS-compilation-and-integration-with-Python/" /> <author> <name>Spica.Vir</name> </author> <category term="Technique" /> <category term="Parallel Computing" /> <summary> Procedures to Compile LAMMPS as both static and dynamic libs are summarized in this post. When compiled as the dynamic lib, the integration of LAMMPS and python environment is briefly explored. The compiled version of LAMMPS is 23Jun2022, with OpenMP threading, GPU acceleration and FFT by FFTW3. Tested on NHPC101 (OpenSUSE Leap 15.3), from Dec. 28 to Dec. 30 2022.
